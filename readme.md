# TCLog 
## Version 1.1.1 
The TCLog is the logger that outputs logs as XML. 
The log can be accessed through various connections such as [Python](https://www.python.org) or [c #](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_ (programming_language)) or other programming languages . 
The log follows a clear XML Schema that is followed to allow an error-free function. 
The logs can also be read in a browser by exporting them as HTML. 
The TCLog Api also enables the connection in any Java project where cross-platform use of the tool is made possible.
The whole project runs under the [GNU PUBLIC LICENS](license.md) changes can be found in the [changelog](changelog.md)
